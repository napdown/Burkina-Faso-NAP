<p>Burkina Faso is a landlocked country in sub-Saharan Africa located in the heart of West Africa in the Niger River Loop area. It is located between 9°20’ and 15°05’ north latitude, 5°20’ west longitude and 2°03’ east longitude. It covers an area of 274,200 km². The country is bordered to the north and west by Mali, to the east by Niger, and to the south by Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo and Benin. It stretches 625 km from north to south and 850 km from east to west. Burkina Faso is a landlocked country and depends on its neighbours (Togo, Benin, Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire) for port traffic.</p>
<p>Administratively, Burkina Faso is divided into 13 regions, 45 provinces, 351 departments or communes, and 8,228 villages. There are 49 urban communes, including Ouagadougou, the political capital, and Bobo-Dioulasso, the economic capital (Figure 1). Since 2004, Burkina Faso has embarked on a policy of decentralization with the aim of strengthening the capacity of local authorities to act through the creation of local authorities.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Socio-economic context<a href="national-circumstances-review-of-the-implementation-of-the-first-nap-review-process-and-climate-projections.html#socio-economic-context" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>According to the report of the fifth General Population and Housing Census (RGPH, 2019), the country has about 20.5 million inhabitants with 51.7% women and 48.3% men, an increase of 7 million inhabitants compared to the last census carried out in 2006. The average annual population growth rate is 2.94% (RGPH 2019). During the same period, the population density increased from 51.4 to 75.1 inhabitants/km2. The Burkinabe population is predominantly young; More than 77.9% of the population is under the age of 35 and 51.8% is under the age of 17.</p>
<p>Since 2016, the country has been experiencing a period of insecurity due to terrorist attacks. This situation has led to massive internal displacement of populations from insecure to relatively peaceful areas. A total of 1.99 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) have been registered by the Permanent Secretariat of the National Council for Emergency Relief and Rehabilitation (SP/CONASUR) as of 28 February 2023 compared to 1.94 million as of 31 January 2022, an increase of 3%. Most of these displaced people, who left without their luggage, have no other means of survival than the untimely exploitation of natural resources in the host areas. In addition to these internally displaced persons, there are populations that traditionally migrate from arid climatic zones to more suitable and exploitable agricultural areas.</p>
<p>The majority of the Burkinabe population lives in a general state of poverty and constant impoverishment. The poverty rate increased from 41.4% in 2018 to 43.2% in 2021. The country is also characterized by a high illiteracy rate among people over the age of 15, standing at 61.7% in 2018 (EHCVM 2018). The value of the Human Development Index (HDI) increased from 0.439 in 2017 to 0.449 in 2021 with a rank of 184th out of 191 countries ranked according to UNDP’s Human Development Report (2021-2022).</p>
<p>Economically, the primary sector (agricultural and sylvo-pastoral activities) contributes more than 30% to Burkina Faso’s GDP and employs more than 80% of the population (NANA, 2019). The fact that the largest part of the population depends on natural resources and rain-fed agriculture, climate change exacerbates rural poverty and increases anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.</p>
<p>Although this sector of activity is very important for the country’s economy, its high dependence on rainwater exposes it to the effects of climate change, calling into question the socio-economic development process of Burkina Faso (MERH, 2015). Hence the need to analyse the level of vulnerability of populations and to develop and implement appropriate adaptation strategies in order to strengthen their resilience to the adverse effects of climate change.</p>

<p>The national territory of Burkina Faso is entirely drained by 3 international rivers, the Comoé, the Niger and the Volta, whose main tributaries are the Mouhoun and the Nakanbé (including Pendjari, Kompienga). For practical reasons of management and compliance with the principle of water resources management by basin, the national territory has been divided into 5 areas of competence for the management of water resources of river basins, resulting from a combination of the best possible administrative division (regions, provinces, municipalities) and the natural boundaries of the national river basins of the three (3) main international rivers. Water resources remain the country’s main challenge, compromising its economic and social development (LAME, 2012).</p>

<p>Burkina Faso has two main types of landscapes from the point of view of relief:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The largest part of the country is covered by a peneplain. It forms a very slightly undulating relief with a few isolated hills in places, the last vestiges of a Precambrian massif. It is a rather monotonous landscape, with a soil very often coloured ochre by laterite.</p></li>
<li><p>The southwestern part of the country forms a sandstone massif. It is home to the highest point in the country: Ténakourou (749 m). The massif is bounded by very steep cliffs up to 150 m high: the cliffs of Banfora, the peaks of Sindou, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The average altitude is 400 m and the difference between the two extreme points does not exceed 600 m. Burkina Faso is therefore a rather flat country, with some localized terrain accidents. This configuration is not conducive to efficient rainwater retention for agriculture and other uses.</p>
<p>From a pedological point of view, there are nine (09) soil classes in Burkina Faso:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Raw mineral soils</strong> can be found on breastplates or surface formations that have not yet undergone or cannot undergo a soil evolution. These soils do not have a specific location. They are scattered throughout the country and represent three per cent of the total area of the country;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Poorly developed soils</strong> have a poorly differentiated profile in which the humus-rich horizon transitions to the original material by a more or less rapid transition. This slight change in the profile is due either to a slight impact of the climate or to the action of erosion which slows down the processes of alteration of materials at depth. Like raw mineral soils, they are found everywhere. But those with a basic facies are specific to certain regions such as Poni, Mouhoun; they cover 26% of the total area;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vertisols</strong> grow on basic rocks or on alluvium or colluvium from basic bedrock. They are deep soils (&gt; 120 cm), dark in colour. However, these soils are poor in organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Vertisols are found particularly in the provinces of Sourou, Nahouri, Sanguié, Boulgou, Gourma, and Zoundwéogo. They represent 6% of the total area;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isohumic soils</strong> are deep to medium-deep soils, growing on basic crystalline and metamorphic rocks or on calcareous sedimentary rocks. Their dominant hue is usually red due to the very extensive alteration of the minerals. Chemically, they are low in organic matter. They are rich in calcium and magnesium. Sometimes, sodium levels can be relatively high. Isohumic soils are represented in Burkina Faso by sub-arid brown soils located in the north of the country;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Brown soils</strong> are found in the western, south-west, north-central, northwestern and eastern parts of the country. They represent 6% of the total area. These soils have a good mineral content, limited however by deficiencies in nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Within the class of soils with iron and manganese sesquioxides</strong>, the subclass of <strong>tropical ferruginous soils</strong> is the most widespread (39%). Its soils are characterized by a poverty of mineral elements;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ferralitic soils</strong> develop on coarse sandstones (quartz-eyed sandstone) with a rainfall of between 1000 and 1200 mm. They are found in the west of the country, particularly in the provinces of Houet, Kénédougou, Comoé and in the southern part of the province of Mouhoun (Bondoukuy). They represent 2% of the total area;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sodic or salsodic soils</strong> are located in the Centre-South, Centre-North and East of the country. They occupy 5% of the total area. They are compact soils with an unstable structure. The texture is medium to fine. They contain a significant amount of exchangeable sodium, which explains the instability of the structure;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hydromorphic soils</strong> are found in the different regions of the country around major rivers (Mouhoun, Nakanbé, Nazinon), in the major riverbeds. They represent 13% of the country’s land area. In terms of importance, they are the third most important after ferruginous soils and poorly developed soils.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The relative poverty of the soil for agricultural activities has led producers to develop the production of organic manure.</p>

<p>The territory of Burkina Faso is divided into four phytogeographical sectors of Burkina Faso (Fontès and Guinko, 1995): the strict Sahel, the sub-Sahel, the North Sudanian and the South Sudanian, marked by climatic conditions. According to the IFN2 report (MEEVCC, 2016), the types of forest formations encountered at the country level are: open forest, gallery forest, wooded savannah, shrub and grassy savannah, wooded steppe, shrub and grassy steppe, forest plantations and orchards. In particular, these forest formations are interspersed with agroforestry parks.</p>

<p>Burkina Faso is subdivided into three distinct agro-climatic zones: the Sahelian zone in the north, the North Sudanian zone in the centre and the South Sudanian zone in the southwest. The boundaries of these subdivisions have migrated southward under the influence of climate change, as shown in Figures 2(a) and 2(b). The characteristics of each area are summarized in Table 1. The most significant climatic factor is rainfall, which decreases from north to south and is subject to strong seasonal and interannual variations, resulting in pronounced droughts or floods in some years with increasing frequency.</p>
<p>The very severe droughts of 1972-74 and 1983-84 left a strong mark on the country with their procession of disasters: decimated herds, poor harvests, famine, displaced populations, etc. These major natural calamities have encouraged national and international public awareness of the climate impacts and the great vulnerability of the Burkinabe population in particular and the Sahelian population in general. As a result of these events, sub-regional institutions such as the Inter-State Committee for the Fight against Drought in the Sahel (CILSS), headquartered in Burkina Faso, came into being on 12 September 1973.</p>

<p>In terms of rainfall, taking the 1961-1990 normal as a reference in space, the 1981-2010 normal shows an increase in rainfall and shows a rise in the 600 mm and 900 mm isohyets towards the north. This increase is very pronounced in the last period 1990-2018 (Figure 4).</p>
<p>Precipitation indices show trends towards wetter conditions for annual precipitation (PRCPTOT), 1-day (RX1day) and 5-day (RX5days) maximum indices, extremely wet days (R99p). For the trend in the number of consecutive dry days (CDD), there is a slight decrease (&lt;3 days/decade) corresponding to an increase in the number of rainy days in the eastern half of the country, while in the western half, there is a small increase in pockets of drought within the rainy season (3 days/decade).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>repeated droughts in the years 1970-1973, 1983-1984, 1984-1985, 1991-1992, 1997-1998, 2003-2004 and 2011-2012 which led to loss of life and livestock, strong population migrations, and a significant drop in river levels;</p></li>

<p>The evaluation was conducted for the period 2015-2020, with the support of the NAP Global Network and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD). It was carried out in a participatory manner with the actors of the sectors concerned by the NAP through an administrative decision setting up a team for the evaluation called the “Technical Working Group”.</p>
<p>The evaluation noted the progress made and the gains made, but also the shortcomings and challenges to be addressed in the new phase.</p>
<p>In terms of progress and achievements, the evaluation of the implementation of the development sectors targeted in the NAP shows that out of a total of 143 programmed actions, 96 actions have been carried out or are in the process of being implemented, i.e. a rate of 67% against 47 actions that have not started to get off the ground, i.e. a rate of 33%. Regarding the cross-cutting themes addressed (Gender and CSOs), gender did not carry out any activities and the activities carried out by CSOs could not be evaluated. However, it should be noted that many actions are being implemented in these two sectors, except that these actions were not included in the respective sectoral NAPs. These actions will be integrated into the new NAP.</p>

<p>Among the difficulties and obstacles that have hindered the implementation of the previous NAP and that may be lessons for the new document, are: (i) the lack of awareness of the NAP by some actors of its implementation; (ii) the lack of institutional accountability for the actions of the NAP in conjunction with civil society and women’s organizations; (iii) the non-operationalization of the institutional mechanism for monitoring and evaluation of the NAP; (iv) the inadequacy of gender mainstreaming in the monitoring of the implementation of NAP actions; (v) insufficient financial resources for the implementation of adaptation actions, (vi) the country’s deleterious security situation and (vii) the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In view of the diagnosis of the shortcomings and difficulties identified, palliative solutions have been proposed in order to improve the revised NAP.</p>

<p>The positive actions (or initiatives) undertaken in favour of the implementation of the NAP have been as follows: (i) the institutionalisation of the NAP and NDC focal points which should ultimately make it possible to resolve the difficulties of monitoring actions at the sectoral level, (ii) the gradual inclusion of actions related to the NAP in the programmes of activities of certain ministerial departments, (iii) the development of the Institutional Capacity Building Programme in relation to the implementation of the NAP, (iv) the continuous capacity building of stakeholders on the NAP and the NDC.</p>
<p>A few points of recommendation have been formulated and to be taken into consideration for the future: (i) to promote the dynamism of a framework for consultation between the implementing actors and to hold periodic follow-up meetings; (ii) strengthen the capacities of implementing actors on strategies for mobilizing financial resources for the implementation of the NAP; (iii) align the NAP with the SDGs; (iv) ensure that the NAP is taken into account in development frameworks; (v) identify and create a database to facilitate the monitoring of civil society actions working in the fight against climate change and involve them in implementation; (vii) clearly define actions and their short-, medium- and long-term targets to facilitate monitoring and evaluation; (viii) strengthen the skills of the NAP focal points to facilitate the monitoring and reporting of the actions of their respective sectors in relation to the NAP; and (ix) develop and implement an NAP Communication Plan.</p>

<p>While the development of an NAP is essential for countries to address climate change and ensure sustainable development, however, changes in the climate and socio-economic context mean that the priorities and challenges addressed may change from one NAP to another. In addition to droughts and floods, the new challenges to be integrated into this NAP are heat waves, the delay of the rainy season and its early end (SP/CNDD, 2023). The adaptation priorities of this NAP are in line with the main development axes of the National Economic and Social Development Plan (PNDES II; 2021-2025) which are: (1) consolidating resilience, security, social cohesion and peace; (2): deepening institutional reforms and modernizing public administration; (3): consolidating human capital development and national solidarity; (4) : boost sectors that are promising for the economy and jobs.</p>

<p>The process of revising the NAP was led by the Ministry of the Environment and was the recruitment of a national consultant supported by international consultants. A Technical Monitoring Committee (STC) chaired by the Permanent Secretariat of the CNDD has been set up to provide strategic guidance and validate the methodology as well as the interim reports submitted by the consultants. Several semi-structured interviews were conducted with the various stakeholders, particularly the focal points of the ministerial departments. The national consultant also interviewed members of the LDC Expert Group on Climate Change (LEG), resource persons and carried out a documentary dig of climate resilience, sustainable development policies in general and Burkina Faso in particular. The LDC Expert Group’s technical guides or guidelines for the National Adaptation Plan process have been judiciously used in this work.</p>
<p>Finally, the final document was validated by the CTS and then by a national workshop bringing together a wider audience.</p>
<p>Funding for this activity was provided by the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) based in Nairobi through the Capacity-building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT) project.</p>

<p>As a party to the Paris Agreement, Burkina Faso has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions and significant efforts have been made. The country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), adopted in 2015 and revised in 2021, demonstrate the government’s commitment to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 with the support of its technical partners. To determine the climate vulnerability factors used in this NAP, the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) Global Daily Downscaled Projections (GDDP) or NEX-GDDP dataset was used. This dataset comes from a statistical downscaling of general circulation models (GCMs) performed as part of Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) at a spatial resolution of 25 km (Thrasher et al., 2022).</p>
<p>In the previous NAP, scenarios A2, B1 and A1B were used for projections of future climate change for precipitation and temperature. Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) climate change scenarios are used to project the different climate impact factors listed in Table 2. PHS were developed to provide five distinct pathways on future socio-economic developments as they might unfold in the absence of explicit additional policies and measures to limit climate forcing, or to improve adaptive capacity (Riahi et al., 2017). SSP scenarios are used in the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report for climate change projections. In this NAP, three PHCs (SSP1-2.6; SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) and two future periods (2021-2050: near future; 2051-2080: distant future) were considered. SSP1-2.6 roughly corresponds to the previous generation of RCP 2.6 scenarios with a radiative forcing of 2.6 W m-2 by the end of the century. It most closely reflects the 2°C goal of the Paris Agreement and is the highest priority scenario in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). It is followed by the “average” socioeconomic family SSP2-4.5 with a nominal radiative forcing of 4.5 W m-2 by 2100, roughly equivalent to the RCP-4.5 scenario. Finally, the SSP5-8.5 scenario marks the upper limit of the SSP scenario spectrum with a high reference scenario (business as usual) in a fossil fuel-intensive world in the XXITh century. It has a radiative forcing of 8.5 W m-2 by the end of the century, like the RCP8.5 scenario that preceded it.</p>
<p>For climate projections, the “multi-model average set” was used, which provides better performance than a single model. It is formed by combining a set of models with equal weights and has a higher probability of producing a better result than a single model (Sawadogo et al., 2019). It also performs better in terms of long-term climate change projections than any single model (Houghton et al., 2001). Nevertheless, 80% of models must agree on the sign of changes to be considered robust changes (Fischer et al., 2014). The agreement of the models is shown in the figures as a pie chart. In addition, the average of the models should indicate that the projected change is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, based on a (Student’s) test. Significant areas at the 95% confidence level are represented in the figures as dots. We chose the period 1985-2014 as the reference period.</p>
<p>The various studies of vulnerability and impacts of climate change have made it possible to identify the different climate risk factors and their impacts on the different sectors of activity (Arisco et al., 2023; Ibrahim et al., 2014; Ouedraogo et al., 2012).</p>

<p>The overall average of the models projects a generally early onset of precipitation in the near and distant future over Burkina Faso (Figures 5 &amp; 6). In the near future, the northern part of the country could experience a significant early start to the rainy season and this is more pronounced in and in the SSP5-8.5 scenario. In the distant future, most parts of the West could experience a significant delay in precipitation of up to 5 days. However, there is a divergence between the models in terms of the sign of projection in the two periods. For example, 53% of models predict an early onset date of precipitation, while 47% show a late onset of precipitation under the SSP1-2.6 scenario and in the near future. In contrast to the date of the start of the rains, more than 80% of the models agree with the sign of increasing rain stop both in the near future and in the future. This is also confirmed for the duration of the rainy season, where all models show a significant increase but there is less agreement between models, especially the SSP1-2.6 scenario. Overall, the country could experience a significantly longer rainy season in the coming years. This significant increase is more pronounced in the SSP5-8.5 model and at the end of the century. The length of the rainy season could also increase by 10 to 15 days, especially in the northern part of the country. In conclusion, farmers will need to adapt their cropping practices to expected changes in the onset and length of the rainy season to reduce crop losses and also use improved seeds to reduce the uncertainty associated with planting timing and the length of the rainy season.</p>
<p>The agreement of the models is shown in the figures as a pie chart. In addition, the average of the models should indicate that the projected change is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, based on a (Student’s) test.</p>

<p>About 80% of the models predict an increase in precipitation in Burkina Faso in all scenarios and periods considered (Fig.7). This increase is significant in all regions with a 95% probability. The increase is more pronounced at the end of the century and in the high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5). This scenario shows an increase of more than 20%, especially in the northern part of the country, for the period 2051-2080. In the optimistic scenario (SSP1-2.6), the country could see a minimum increase of about 5% for both periods. Figure 7 shows the average inter-annual rainfall projection over Burkina Faso. This figure is obtained by aggregating all grid points in the Burkina Faso area. The shading in the figure indicates the minimum and maximum of the models. For each scenario, the model’s ensemble average projects an increase in precipitation towards the end of the century with a maximum increase of about 20%. However, the model shows a high temporal variability in the increase in precipitation for all scenarios and up to 2100. This means that precipitation can vary from year to year but is higher than the reference period (1985-2014). Despite the expected increase in rainfall in the country, a net decrease in water availability is expected due to increased evapotranspiration. The increase in evapotranspiration is consistent between models (Fig. 9). More than 80% of models show that evapotranspiration increases in all scenarios and at all time periods. This increase is also evident in the SSP5-8.5 scenario and the end of the century. Under the SSP1-2.6 scenario, the country’s evapotranspiration is expected to increase by at least 5%. This increase could lead to lower soil moisture and more frequent and severe agricultural droughts. In addition, reduced water availability could affect off-season crops in the coming years and will have serious implications for drinking water management and irrigation. The increase in precipitation and evapotranspiration highlighted here is consistent with the IPCC6 assessment report (Paola et al., 2021).</p>
<p>There is a change in the average rainfall in Burkina Faso compared to the average of all models for the reference period (in black) and three SSPs (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) scenarios (compared to 1985-2014): SSP1-2.6 (in blue), SSP2-4.5 (in green), and SSP5-8.5 (in red).

<p>Air temperatures are expected to rise in Burkina Faso. The overall average of the models predicts a significant increase in air temperature (Figure 10). The temperature rises as climate scenarios change from low to high emissions and towards the end of the century. The western and northern parts of the country will experience greater warming, but the north will have a higher increase. The Sahel, North and Centre-North parts are expected to rise by about 1.0°C (SSP1-2.6), 1.3°C (SSP2-4.5) and 1.5°C (SSP5-8.5) in the near future. 100% of models project greater warming, exceeding 5°C for the period 2051-2080 according to SSP5-8.5 over the northern part of the country. In the east of the country, the warming of air temperature is expected to be lower compared to other regions.</p>
<p>Figure 11 shows the projection of inter-annual air temperature variability under different scenarios. The overall average predicts warming in Burkina Faso compared to the baseline period. Warming under the SSP5-8.5 scenario is projected to continue to increase beyond 2100. The country is expected to experience a warming of about 5.5°C by the end of the century. The SSP1-2.6 and SPP2-4.5 scenarios have similar patterns, but with different amplitudes. In other words, warming in Burkina Faso could stabilize below both SSPs, with a maximum of 2.0°C and 1.0°C under SSP2-4.5 and SSP1-2.6, respectively. Based on SSP1-2.6, the country is projected to warm by 0.9°C and 1.1°C between 2021-2050 and 2051-2080, respectively (Figure 11). February shows the highest temperature increase for the period 2021-2050 under SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5, while May shows the largest increase for the period 2051-2080 under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5. Without any mitigation strategy, average temperature increases could reach 2.8°C below SSP5-8.5; May and April were the months with the highest increases over the 2021-2050 and 2051-2070 periods, respectively. In addition, the average air temperature is expected to reach 4.2°C in the distant future and reach 1.5°C in the near future. The models even predict warming during the harmattan period (December-January-February) in all scenarios and periods considered. High temperatures are particularly damaging to crop production when they occur during the flowering period of crops. This indicates that rising air temperatures in Burkina Faso could cause damage to agriculture. In addition, rising temperatures could also reduce the potential for photovoltaic power generation in the country, as solar PV technology is sensitive to rising air temperatures (Sawadogo et al., 2020).</p>

<p>To characterize drought, the maximum number of consecutive dry days during the rainy season with daily rainfall of less than 1 mm was used. The increase in this index means that the probability of drought conditions increases (Figure 13). It is expected that the maximum number of consecutive dry days in some parts of the country under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 will increase in the distant future. In other words: Drought conditions could occur in the western part of the country. In the central and northern parts of the country, a decrease of about 1 day is expected. However, these changes are not significant, except for SSP2-4.5 for the period 2051-2080. In addition, there is no agreement between the models on the changes in the sign of the maximum dry period in the country as less than 80% of the models agree on the sign of the change. Uncertainty decreases towards the end of the century, especially with SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. In the SSP5-8.5 scenario, only 65% of the models agree on a significant decrease in this drought index of about 1 day, expected in the eastern part of the country. These projected changes in this region should be used to formulate climate change adaptation measures. However, the non-significant changes expected in other regions under different scenarios and time periods should not deter policymakers and stakeholders from taking action to reduce the impact of drought events in agriculture. Indeed, these regions are currently experiencing frequent droughts and have a huge impact on cereal production (Africa RiskView, 2020).</p>

<p>The flood index used here is defined as the maximum amount of precipitation over five days in a given period. This is a measure of heavy precipitation, with high values indicating a high probability of flooding. An increase in this index over time means that the risk of flooding will increase. The overall average of the models predicts an increase in the flood index in Burkina Faso (Figure 14). All models agree on the sign of a significant increase in flood risk in all regions of the country. The magnitude of change increases as the climate change scenario moves towards the highest emissions scenario. In other words, the risk of flooding is more pronounced in the SSP5-8.5 scenario than in the SSP1-2.6 scenario. In addition, the increase is more intense in the distant future than in the near future. The risk of flooding is expected to increase by more than 20% in the country, especially in the period 2051-2080. The north and east of the country are expected to see a larger increase. Under the SSP1-2.6 scenario, the risk of flooding could increase by 5% per year in the near future, while it doubles in the distant future.</p>
<p>Another climate index was also used to determine the number of days per period with daily precipitation of at least 20 mm. This climate index is a measure of extreme precipitation, with high values associated with a high probability of flooding. An increase in this index over time means that the risk of flooding will increase. As with the 5 consecutive rainy days, the number of rainfall events greater than 20 mm/year will increase in the country (Figure 15). More than 80% of the models agree on the sign of change and they are all statically significant at a 95% confidence level. The occurrence of heavy precipitation events also increases when the level scenario increases and the frequency of the number of days in the distant future are high. The SSP5-8.5 scenario shows the largest increase for the different periods considered. The number of days is expected to increase by more than 4 days. Flooding may be more frequent in the eastern part of the country. The increased risk of flooding could displace many people and important infrastructure could be damaged. Increased flood risk could also lead to an increase in waterborne diseases and threaten health systems due to stagnant waters, flooding of water supplies, and disruption of water supply and sanitation systems. In addition, flood risk can also contribute to reduced crop yields, loss of beneficial soil invertebrates, including earthworms, and increased risk of animal diseases such as liver fluke infestation.</p>

<p>All models agree on the projected change in heat stress days in Burkina Faso (Figure 16). Heat stress days above 41°C are likely to increase in Burkina Faso. The number of days varies depending on the scenario and time period. SSP1-2.6 shows the smallest increase (up to 30 days), while SSP5-8.5 shows the largest increase (up to 80 days) for the period 2021-2050. The increase in the number of heat stress days is most pronounced for the period 2051-2080. In the northern part of the country, the increase will be small compared to other regions in all scenarios and periods because the relative humidity in this area is low. However, more people will suffer from heat cramps and exhaustion, especially in the western part of the country. Under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, an increase of about 160 days of heat stress per year is projected by the end of the century.</p>

<p>To quantify the temporal distribution of heat stress throughout the year, Figure 17 shows the number of heat stress days above 41°C per month. This figure is obtained by averaging all grid points in the Burkina Faso domain with the overall average of the models. The overall average predicts an increase in heat stress days throughout the year for all scenarios and periods. In both time periods, the SSP5-8.5 scenario has the highest number of heat stress days. The number of heat-stressed days may increase in March and July for all three climate scenarios and the period considered, but more intensively in the period 2051-2080. Approximately 14 days in March and 11 days in June may exhibit more heat stress under the SSP5-8.5 scenario in the distant future. For the period 2021-2080, March, April, June, July, and November show a slightly similar increase in the number of days in all scenarios (~6 days). The smallest increase may occur in September and October (~1 day) in the near future, while in the distant future the months of October and January could be likely to increase by more than 3 days.</p>

<p>The increase in hot days could also increase health risks for the population and reduce work capacity. Cognitive fatigue and difficulty concentrating, which reduce work efficiency due to increased temperature, can lead to productivity losses (Maula et al., 2016). In addition, at high relative humidity levels, the body stops evaporating water, which prevents the cooling effect of the body and leads to heat illness. Recurrent symptoms such as heat exhaustion are likely. Heat stroke is likely with prolonged exposure and/or physical activity. Older adults (&gt; 65 years of age) may be at higher risk. In summary, Burkina Faso should expect an increase in heat stress days, regardless of the climate change scenario. The western part is known as the economic lung of the country; the expected significant increase in the number of heat stress days could affect the socio-economic activities of the region and thus reduce the country’s GDP. There are steps and strategies that need to be taken to accommodate the future increase in heat stress days.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.7.8</span> Cooling Degree Days<a href="national-circumstances-review-of-the-implementation-of-the-first-nap-review-process-and-climate-projections.html#cooling-degree-days" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>To characterize the energy demand for cooling a building as a function of climate change, cooling degree days are typically used. A degree-day is defined as the difference between the average daily temperature and a given reference temperature. The most common reference temperature for cooling is around 22°C (Shi et al., 2016). However, this threshold varies according to socio-economic activities, building characteristics and climatic conditions. In Burkina Faso, we assume that thermal comfort is below 30°C. Therefore, cooling degree days are calculated when the temperature of the cooling degree days exceeds 30°C. In other words: we need to cool a building when this value is reached.</p>
<p>All models agree on the sign of a significant increase in cooling degree days in Burkina Faso (Figure 18). The number of days per year increases with the level of the scenario and accelerates towards the end of the century. The number of days is higher in the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The number of days per year exceeds 150 for the period 2051-2080. In the SSP1-2.6 scenario, the number of days could reach about 25 days per year for the period 2021-2050, while it could double for the period 2051-2080. As with heat stress days, some areas in the west of the country could see the largest increase. October shows the largest increase in cooling degree days, while April shows the smallest increase under the SSP5-8.5 scenario for the near and distant future (Figure 19). In March and April, during the hot season, the country already has a high value of cooling degree days; With climate change, the country could experience more months when we need air conditioning for cooling. Global warming could significantly increase the energy consumption of buildings in Burkina Faso, where the country has a low energy security index (IRENA, 2021). Appropriate measures need to be taken by considering the future impact of climate on the characteristics of buildings in the country and by producing more energy, mainly from renewable sources, for cooling buildings.</p>

<p>To better understand the exposure of the population to the impacts of climate change, the total change in exposure (in person events) of the approach developed by Jones et al. (2015) was used. The total change in exposure is defined here as the exposure of the population to the flood risk index, drought and heat stress. It is calculated by taking the average of all grid points in the Burkina Faso zone, the different climate impact factors and population data. The population data were developed by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (CNRA) and are consistent with the SSP scenarios. The spatial resolution of the data is approximately 1 km and the temporal resolution ranges from 2010 to 2100 for the different SSPs (SSP1, SSP2, SSP3, SSP4 and SSP5) in 10-year increments. Historical population data are from Protocol 2b of the Inter-Comparison of Intersectoral Impact Models (ISIMIP2b) project, which serves as the base year (2010). As the PHS population data are presented in 10-year increments, the period 2020-2050 is considered the near future and the period 2050-2080 is considered the far future. Table 3 summarizes the matrix with the PHC definitions for the demographic and human capital components for the high-fertility country. From this table, it is clear that SSP2 scenarios show the highest population growth.</p>

<p>Approximately two (2) million people in Burkina Faso may be affected by floods in the coming years according to SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios (Figure 20a). This number could increase in the SSP2-4.5 scenario. In addition, approximately 4 million people could be exposed to heat stress in the near future in SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios (Figure 20b). Under scenario SPP2-4.5, the number of populations likely to be affected could increase by about 4.5 million in the period 2021-2050 and by 7.5 million in the period 2051-2080. This could put a strain on health systems and lead to an increase in heat-related deaths due to rising temperatures. About 70% of Burkina Faso’s population depends on rainfed agriculture for their livelihoods (Sorghum et al., 2021), meaning that any increase in the drought index could lead to widespread food insecurity.</p>
<p>SSP2-4.5 models predict that approximately 250,000 people will be affected by projected changes in the drought index in both the short and long term (see Figure 20b). Conversely, SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios show more impacts on the drought index in the long term (200,000 people) than in the short term (150,000 people).</p>

<p>Figure 21 summarizes all the projections averaged for Burkina Faso for different climate change scenarios and time periods. The average of all models agrees on most projected climate impacts, with the exception of the onset of rainfall and the drought index. The overall average of the models predicts a significant increase in most climate impact factors in Burkina Faso. The country is facing many impacts of climate change, and given these climate projections, the country will be even more vulnerable if adaptation strategies are not implemented. The value of each cell indicates the actionable changes. The red down arrow indicates a decrease in change, the yellow right arrow indicates no change, and the up arrow shows an increase in change. The symbol with the red cross indicates that the models do not match, while the checkmark indicates that more than 80% of the models agree on the sign of the changes.</p>
<p>For the prioritization of adaptation measures, the climate risk factors in the context of this NAP are grouped into three major climate risks, namely drought, floods and extreme heat (see Table 4).</p>
